## Deployment

1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g. `the-arab-style`).
2. Push all website files to the `main` branch.
3. In GitHub settings, under “Pages”, select the main branch as the source.
4. GitHub Pages will publish the site at `https://<username>.github.io/the-arab-style/`.
5. Ensure all asset paths (`css/style.css`, `images/hero.png`, etc.) are correct relative to the HTML files.
6. The site is static, so no additional server setup is required.
